===============

Bootstrap 3.2 extension to add a breakpoint at 550 px.

I have exended the @andyl's code found here:  
https://gist.github.com/andyl/6360906


As screens get smaller, I've noticed I want more breakpoints for good responsive design. This code allows me to use bootstrap, but adds an additional breakpoints. The range below 480 pixles is "xs", 480 to 549 pixles is "jt" and the range from 550 to 779 is "ms" 

The new breakpoints are as follow

|  -->  xs|  -->  jt|  -->  ms|  -->  sm|

0px     480px     550px      780px    992px
